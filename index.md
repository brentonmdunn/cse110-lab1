- Projects that are currently a work in progress:
- [ ] [Rides Coordinator Bot](https://github.com/brentonmdunn/rides-coordinator-bot)
- [ ] [Grade Distributions Project](https://brentonmdunn.github.io/grade-distributions/)
- In LIGN 42 (Linguistics of Memes), this was the opening paragraph of our final project:
  > Sticking out your gyat for the rizzler, you’re so skibidi, you’re so fanum tax. Can you believe that this is a real song? Can you understand the meaning of that sentence? Gen Z and Millennials alike have been amazed, and sometimes even dumbfounded, by the new meme words coming from Gen Alpha. As Gen Alpha’s presence on social media increases, we have seen various terms be created while terms that were popular among Gen Z are “out” or “cringe”.
- Since students no longer take CSE 15L/29 and CSE 12 concurrently, a lot of students in CSE 12 do not know how to use the command line, so they are having trouble when they need to `cd` into the starter code folder. They now need to do the following:
```
cd starter
javac main.java
java main
```
